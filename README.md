Hello my name is Tonito Abello!

As a senior at Boston University majoring in Computer Science, I am enthusiastic about the synergy between technology, creativity, and problem solving. My academic and personal projects have allowed me to explore machine learning models and working with data sets, as well as game designing and game programing.

I have cultivated an interest in machine learning because of its ability to transform gameplay, but also its broader applications to technology. Not only am I excited by the way ML can enhance game development, but I see machine learning as a powerful tool for analyzing complex data, uncovering patterns, and building systems that can adapt to real-world challenges.

By combining my background in computer science with my enthusiasm for creative design, I aim to make projects that push the boundaries of entertainment and technology. Whether its developing immersive virtual worlds, or using ML to build a smarter system, I am eager to continue growing as a developer and programmer to bridge the gap between creativity and engineering.

Projects: 

   Gravebound - Starting in August of 2025, Gravebound is a game I designed and presented to both my team and Irving and other heads of Ludenwright. Both liked the idea and pitch so we are moving forth with developing it in Unity. This game is a 4 person coop based on Appalachian folk tales of Wendigos. We are currently working on implementing the first map which is a hedge maze filled with monsters and puzzles. A full description and Idea board is linked below. I will also be programing this game alongside of designing it. More information can be found on my LinkedIn under the Gravbound description.

   Rebreather - During the Summer of 2025 and to the present, I have been helping debug and code for my team Oceanus under both Ludenwright and P1 Games this game named Rebreather. This game is a exploring/collection game in which you are a diver that collects trash and examines and collects fish on various different maps. There are enemies in the water that you have to avoid such as sharks, jellyfish, and sea urchins. The player also has an oxygen tank and has to come up for water every so often as to not drown. This game focuses on environmentalism and bringing awareness to environmental health. We are currently working on getting this game monetized.

   Golden Laberynth - Over the summer of 2024, I created a small dungeon puzzle video game in Unreal Engine 5 through an academic course. This project utilizes the fusion of both C++ functions and blueprint code to make this game come alive. This game starts off outside a dungeon and leads the player through a series of puzzles to, in the end, obtain treasure. I have completed the game, however, I am currently adding new and exciting puzzles to add more complexity to the game. Through the creation of this game I learned many valuable skills such as learning how to call C++ functions in blueprint, learning the lighting system of lumen, how to utilize actor and scene components in blueprint, as well as line tracing and collisions between players and objects.

   Tumble Trouble - Throughout the summer of 2024 I developed a small puzzle platformer video game in Unreal Engine 5 through an academic course. This puzzle platformer uses both C++ and blueprint to implement the various aspect of the game. This game starts the player off on an island in the sky where they are presented with different obstacles such as moving/rotating pillars, platforms, and blocks, and they have to maneuver through these to get to the end. Through the creation of this video game I learned how to utilize UPROPERTY and UE_LOG in C++, FStrings, FVectors, and FRotators, blueprint child classes of C++, and GameMode in Unreal Engine 5.

   Warehouse Wreakage - At the beginning of the summer of 2024, I created a small arcade destruction video game in Unreal Engine 5 through an academic course. This arcade game was created utilizing blueprint in Unreal Engine 5 to create the foundations of the game. This game spawns the player in the center of a warehouse where there are multiple barrels in front of the player. The objective is to knock down all the barrels with a limited amount of ammo. By creating this game, I learned the basics of both Unreal Engine 5 and blueprint. Come skills learned were Unreal's maps, actors, components, transforms, and vectors, as well the blueprint basics of nodes, pins, events, functions, and blueprint classes.
